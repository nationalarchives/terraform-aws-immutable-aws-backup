Some services, like S3, do not have a native backup solution, so have implemented workflows specifically for AWS Backup. For this reason, AWS Backup behaves differently depending on the underlying resource type being backed up.

Although keys cannot be deleted immediately, they can be scheduled for deletion with only 7 days grace. Keys can be protected through Key Policies, such as removing the ability to schedule key deletions or update the key policy, but this is a known issue within AWS and has a well documented path to recover these abilities through opening a case with AWS Support.</p> <p>AWS identified this issue and launched Logically Air Gapped (LAG) Vaults; among other features, these vaults re-encrypt their contents with an AWS Owned Key. But, not all AWS resource types are supported by LAG Vaults, creating a complex matrix of resources and vault types.</p> <p>This module solves these issues by moving backups to a vault encrypted with an AWS Managed Key. Both AWS Managed and AWS Owned Keys cannot be deleted by principals within an AWS account. When the <code>use_logically_air_gapped_vault</code> option is enabled within a plan, only resources that are not supported by LAG Vaults are handled in this way, reducing the time and complexity to recover.</p>"},{"location":"why-use-this-module/#how-can-aws-backup-grant-access-to-data","title":"How can AWS Backup grant access to data?","text":"<p>Some services within AWS Backup are \"fully managed\". These services simplify the backup lifecycle by automatically re-encrypting the data during a Backup Job using the KMS Key of the target Backup Vault. Whilst this is convenient and defends against the deletion of the source KMS Key, it creates another Key to manage which can have different access permissions. In accounts where permissions are not managed carefully, this can lead to data being accessible to principals that should not have access. For example, a user who couldn't GetObject in an S3 bucket could restore the backup to a new bucket then access the data.</p>"}]}
